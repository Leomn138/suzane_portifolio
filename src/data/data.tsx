  description: `I am a Berlin-based Product Designer with a passion for UI/UX design. 
  Currently, I'm working at Ironhack as a UI/UX Designer Teacher Assistant, where I have the opportunity to mentor and train over 60 students and newcomer designers. 
  My role involves creating a supportive learning environment, providing guidance on design principles, and helping students develop their skills in user interface and user experience design. 
  I am dedicated to helping aspiring designers grow and thrive in their design journey, and I take pride in contributing to the next generation of design professionals.

  When I'm not designing, you can find me spending time in the kitchen, experimenting with different ingredients and cooking up some meals. 
  I also have a green thumb and enjoy taking care of my growing collection of plants, nurturing them and watching them thrive. 
  Additionally, I find solace in nature and love exploring beautiful landscapes.`,
